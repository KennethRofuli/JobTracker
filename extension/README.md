## ⚠️ Multiple Users on Same Computer

**IMPORTANT**: If multiple people use Job Tracker on the same computer:

1. **Always log out from the extension** when switching users
2. Click the extension icon → Click "Logout" button  
3. The next user should log in with their own account

**Why?** The extension stores login tokens locally in Chrome. If User A logs out from the website but NOT the extension, and User B logs in to the website, the extension will still use User A's token. This causes jobs to be saved to the wrong account and shows "already saved" errors.

**Best Practice:**
- When done using Job Tracker, logout from BOTH:
  - ✓ The website dashboard (click Logout button)
  - ✓ The browser extension (click extension icon → Logout)

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

- **"Already saved" error when different users try to save same job:** Previous user didn't log out from extension. Click extension icon → Logout → Login with correct account
- **Extension not working?** Make sure your backend is running and you're logged in (click extension icon to check)
- **Can't capture data?** Refresh the job posting page (F5) and try again
- **CORS errors?** Make sure CORS is enabled in your backend (`app.use(cors())`)
